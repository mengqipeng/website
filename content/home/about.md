# Biography

Hello :) This is Mengqi Peng.
Currently, I am a PhD student in HKU, my advisor is Dr. Li-Yi Wei.
I received my bachelor degree from SYSU (Sun Yat-sen University) in 2015.

My research is mainly about Computer Graphics and HCI, in particular interactive/real-time 3D modeling.
I develop systems with novel algorithms and UI features to assist users on various modeling/sculpting tasks, including traditional desktop sculpting/modeling, immersive VR sculpting/painting, and sculpting animations.
